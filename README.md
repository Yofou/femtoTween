> femtoTween

femtoTween's goal is to provide just enough tweening functionality to cover basic use cases.
Through this primary goal, it should also be one of the smallest tweening libraries (less than 1k un-minified even).

```
yarn add femtotween
import { tween } from 'femtotween'
```

- Minimal API can be grok'd in seconds
- Supports a `done` callback - especially useful for [Vue.js transitions via JS hooks](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html#JavaScript-Hooks)
- Supports and provides additional easing functions
